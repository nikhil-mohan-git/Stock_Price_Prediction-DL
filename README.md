This is an Deep Learning project done on Stock Market Prices. The data is obtained from Kaggle and is the Netflix Stock Price Data set from 2002-2022 and the data is collected from Yahoo Finance.

The aim of this project is to apply Deep Learning models such as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and then improve the prediction by using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model.

From the analysis we conclude that the LSTM is the better model compared to the RNN model.
